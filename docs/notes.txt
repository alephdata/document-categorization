config:
one main config file
dict for VGG, Alex within config

see branch custom-python-package

replicate typer cli from preprocessing
init file in each submodule for the library to see
in src: init folder that selects which modules user should use. 

main.py in feature extraction: feature_extraction.py

probably no cli at module-level. there all functions which end user can use. recipes, which bundle several functions

streamlit: in case we want a gui or present something (e.g. for user selecting from config)

everything should be in functions, because otherwise will be called via init

## Build a tool that partner can use.

Packaging:
- plan the functionalities
- create the CLI

Testing
- write the tests (focus on preprocessing, importing data, output of transfer_learning)

## Assessing the model quality

Analysis:
- run with new data from Steve, with company register from Chile/Diego
- see which categories don't work yet (confusion matrix)
- use tf-explain to see which features are highlighted
- download sample image data from the web for testing

## Second feature

Goal:
- build a functional notebook on the model 
- define empty functions/CLI tool
